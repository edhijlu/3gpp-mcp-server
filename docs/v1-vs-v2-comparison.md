## Functional Comparison

### **Core Capabilities**

#### **Search and Discovery**

**V1 Approach**:
```typescript
// Full-text search with semantic understanding
const results = await server.callTool('search_3gpp_specs', {
  query: 'NAS authentication procedures',
  series: ['24'],
  limit: 10
})

// Returns: Actual specification content with relevance scores
```

**V2 Approach**:
```typescript
// Intelligent research guidance
const guidance = await server.callTool('guide_specification_search', {
  query: 'NAS authentication procedures',
  userLevel: 'intermediate'
})

// Returns: Research strategy, suggested specs, methodology
```

#### **Information Depth**

| Information Type | V1 (Data Hosting) | V2 (Guidance) |
|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Specification Text** | ✅ Full content | ❌ No content |
| **Search Results** | ✅ Ranked matches | ❌ No search |
| **Cross-References** | ✅ Document links | ✅ Relationship guidance |
| **Contextual Help** | ⚠️ Basic context | ✅ Rich guidance |
| **Learning Support** | ❌ Minimal | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Methodology** | ❌ None | ✅ Detailed strategies |

#### **Response Examples**

**V1 Response Style**:
```
Found 3 specifications matching "NAS authentication":

**TS 24.301** - Non-Access-Stratum protocol for EPS (Relevance: 85%)
Content: "4.2 Authentication procedures
The authentication procedure is initiated by the network..."
[2000+ words of specification text]

**TS 24.501** - Non-Access-Stratum protocol for 5GS (Relevance: 92%)
Content: "4.2.1 5G-AKA authentication
The 5G-AKA authentication procedure involves..."
[3000+ words of specification text]
```

**V2 Response Style**:
```
For NAS authentication procedures research, I recommend this strategic approach:

**Primary Specifications to Study:**
• TS 24.301 (4G NAS): Sections 4.2-4.4 for EPS authentication
• TS 24.501 (5G NAS): Sections 4.2-4.4 for 5GS authentication
• TS 33.501 (5G Security): Chapter 6 for authentication architecture

**Research Strategy:**
1. Start with TS 33.501 Ch.6 for conceptual overview
2. Compare 4G (TS 24.301) vs 5G (TS 24.501) procedures
3. Focus on key differences: SUCI vs IMSI, 5G-AKA vs EPS-AKA

**Key Search Terms for 3GPP.org:**
- "SUCI encryption", "5G-AKA procedure", "authentication vector"
- Filter by series 24 (protocols) and 33 (security)

**Expected Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand identity protection improvements in 5G
- Know when to use different authentication methods
- Grasp the security architecture evolution
