# Strategic Learning Path for 5G Authentication

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Day 1-2)
**Start with architecture understanding:**
- TS 33.501 Section 6: 5G security architecture overview
- Key entities: UE, AUSF, SEAF, UDM - understand their roles
- Create a diagram: Visual map of authentication flow

## Phase 2: Detailed Procedures (Day 3-5)
**Study the step-by-step processes:**
- TS 24.501 Section 4.2: Authentication procedures
- Focus concepts: SUCI vs SUPI, 5G-AKA process, key derivation
- Hands-on: Trace through complete message flows

## Phase 3: Implementation Requirements (Day 6-7)
**For practical application:**
- TS 33.501 Annex A: Cryptographic algorithms
- Implementation components: SUCI generation, key derivation
- Testing strategies: Validation approaches
```

## Step 2: Deep Dive into Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Follow-up Query:

```
I want to understand the 5G security architecture first. Can you guide me through TS 33.501 Section 6 and explain how the different entities (UE, AUSF, SEAF, UDM) work together in authentication?
```

### What You'll Learn:

The MCP server will provide:
- **Entity roles and responsibilities** clearly explained
- **Interface descriptions** between security functions
- **Message flows** with step-by-step explanations
- **Key concepts** like security anchoring and authentication vectors
- **Visual guidance** on creating your own architecture diagrams

### Practical Exercise:
After getting the MCP guidance, create a simple diagram showing:
- UE connecting to SEAF (in AMF)
- SEAF communicating with AUSF
- AUSF coordinating with UDM
- Key derivation happening at each step

---

## Step 3: Understanding Key Concepts üîë

### Next Query:

```
I'm reading about SUCI and SUPI in the authentication process. Can you explain the difference, why SUCI is needed, and how the privacy protection mechanism works?
```

### What You'll Understand:

- **SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier)**: The actual subscriber identity
- **SUCI (Subscription Concealed Identifier)**: Privacy-protected version
- **Why SUCI matters**: Prevents IMSI catching and tracking
- **How concealment works**: Public key encryption with operator keys
- **Implementation requirements**: ECIES encryption with P-256 curve

### Real-World Context:
The MCP server will explain why this matters:
- Privacy regulations compliance
- Security against passive attacks
- Implementation in different deployment scenarios

## Step 4: Protocol Procedures Deep Dive üìã

### Query for Detailed Understanding:

```
Now I want to understand the actual 5G-AKA authentication procedure step by step. Can you walk me through TS 24.501 Section 4.2 and explain what happens in each message exchange?
```

### What You'll Get:

**Step-by-step procedure breakdown:**
1. Authentication request with SUCI
2. Authentication challenge generation
3. UE response calculation
4. Network verification and key derivation
5. Security context establishment

**For each step, you'll understand:**
- Exact message formats and contents
- Cryptographic operations performed
- Error conditions and handling
- Timing requirements and constraints

### Hands-On Activity:
Use the MCP guidance to trace through a complete authentication:
- Start with a sample SUCI
- Follow the challenge-response process
- Track key derivation at each stage
- Understand final security context

## Step 5: Implementation Planning üîß

### Implementation-Focused Query:

```
I need to implement 5G authentication in our system. Can you provide specific implementation guidance including which components to build, in what order, and common pitfalls to avoid?
```

### What You'll Receive:

**Implementation roadmap:**
- Components to build (SUCI generator, key derivation, message handlers)
- Development sequence (start with simplest, add complexity)
- Testing approach (unit tests with spec test vectors)
- Integration strategy (how components work together)

**Critical implementation details:**
- Algorithm specifications and test vectors
- Error handling requirements
- Performance considerations
- Security requirements and validation

---

## Step 6: Validation and Testing üß™

### Testing Strategy Query:

```
How should I validate my 5G authentication implementation? What test vectors and conformance tests are available?
```

### What You'll Learn:

**Testing methodology:**
- Unit testing with specification test vectors
- Integration testing with test USIM data
- Conformance testing against standard test cases
- Interoperability testing considerations

**Specific test resources:**
