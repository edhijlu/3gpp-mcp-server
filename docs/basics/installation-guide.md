# Installation Guide - 5 Minutes to Expert Guidance

**Goal**: Get the 3GPP MCP Server running and integrated with your AI assistant in 5 minutes

**Result**: Transform any compatible AI from generic responses to expert-level 3GPP guidance

---

## Quick Prerequisites Check ‚úÖ

Before starting, make sure you have:
- **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/) if needed
- **Claude Desktop** or compatible AI assistant
- **5 minutes** of focused time
- **Terminal/Command prompt** access

**Don't worry if you're not technical** - these are simple copy-paste commands!

---

## Step 1: Automated Setup (2 minutes) üì•

### Option A: Automated Setup Script (Recommended)

**For Windows users:**
```cmd
# Download and run setup
git clone https://github.com/your-org/3gpp-mcp-server.git
cd 3gpp-mcp-server/3gpp-mcp-server-v2
mcp-setup.bat
```

**For Mac/Linux users:**
```bash
# Download and run setup
git clone https://github.com/your-org/3gpp-mcp-server.git
cd 3gpp-mcp-server/3gpp-mcp-server-v2
./mcp-setup.sh
```

**What the script does:**
- ‚úÖ Checks Node.js version compatibility
- ‚úÖ Installs all dependencies
- ‚úÖ Builds the MCP server
- ‚úÖ Tests server functionality
- ‚úÖ Generates Claude Desktop configuration
- ‚úÖ Provides next steps

### Option B: Manual Setup

If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
# Download the 3GPP MCP Server
git clone https://github.com/your-org/3gpp-mcp-server.git
cd 3gpp-mcp-server/3gpp-mcp-server-v2

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the server
npm run build

# Test the MCP server
npm run mcp
```

**You should see**:
```
Starting 3GPP MCP Server v2...
Guidance engine initialized successfully
3GPP MCP Server v2 is running
```

**Success!** Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the test. Your server is ready.

## Step 2: Connect to Claude Desktop (2 minutes) üîó

### Find Your Claude Desktop Configuration

**On Windows**:
- File location: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Or open Claude Desktop ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer

**On Mac**:
- File location: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Or open Claude Desktop ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer

**On Linux**:
- File location: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Add the 3GPP MCP Server

**Option A: Use Generated Configuration (Recommended)**

If you used the setup script, it created a file called `claude_desktop_config_generated.json` with the correct paths for your system. Simply:

1. Copy the contents of `claude_desktop_config_generated.json`
2. Paste into your Claude Desktop configuration file

**Option B: Manual Configuration**

Open the configuration file and add this (replace `/path/to/` with your actual path):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "3gpp-guidance": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/3gpp-mcp-server/3gpp-mcp-server-v2",
      "description": "Expert 3GPP telecommunications guidance"
    }
  }
}
```

**Real example for Windows**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "3gpp-guidance": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "C:\\Users\\YourName\\3gpp-mcp-server\\3gpp-mcp-server-v2",
      "description": "Expert 3GPP telecommunications guidance"
    }
  }
}
```

**Real example for Mac/Linux**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "3gpp-guidance": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/Users/yourname/3gpp-mcp-server/3gpp-mcp-server-v2",
      "description": "Expert 3GPP telecommunications guidance"
    }
  }
}
```

**Additional Options:**

For development mode with extra logging:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "3gpp-guidance": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "mcp:dev"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/3gpp-mcp-server/3gpp-mcp-server-v2",
      "description": "3GPP MCP Server (Development Mode)",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Restart Claude Desktop
Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new configuration.

---

## Step 3: Verify It's Working (1 minute) ‚ú®

### Test Query
In Claude Desktop, ask this exact question:

```
Can you give me a strategic learning path for understanding 5G authentication, suitable for someone with technical background but new to 3GPP?
```

### What Success Looks Like
You should get a detailed response that includes:
- ‚úÖ **Specific specification sections** (like "TS 33.501 Section 6")
- ‚úÖ **Structured learning phases** with timeframes
- ‚úÖ **Implementation components** and requirements
- ‚úÖ **Next steps** and related topics
- ‚úÖ **Expert methodology** and best practices

### What Failure Looks Like
If you get a generic response like "5G authentication uses various methods...", the MCP server isn't connected properly.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues üîß

### Issue: "Command not found: node"
**Problem**: Node.js isn't installed or not in PATH
**Solution**: Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and restart terminal

### Issue: "npm install fails"
**Problem**: Network issues or permissions
**Solution**:
```bash
# Try with clean cache
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

### Issue: "Build fails with TypeScript errors"
**Problem**: Version compatibility issues
**Solution**:
```bash
# Update dependencies
npm update
npm run build
```

### Issue: "Claude doesn't show enhanced responses"
**Problem**: MCP server not connected properly
**Solutions**:
1. Check the configuration file path is correct
2. Verify the `cwd` path points to your actual installation
3. Restart Claude Desktop completely
4. Test that `npm start` works in the server directory

### Issue: "Server starts but no improvement in responses"
**Problem**: Query not triggering 3GPP domain recognition
**Solution**: Make sure your questions include 3GPP-related terms like:
- "5G", "3GPP", "LTE", "NAS", "RRC"
- "specifications", "TS 24.501", "authentication"
- "mobile network", "telecommunications"

## Advanced Configuration (Optional) ‚öôÔ∏è

### Multiple AI Assistants
You can connect the same MCP server to multiple AI assistants:

**For ChatGPT** (if supported):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "3gpp-guidance": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/3gpp-mcp-server/3gpp-mcp-server-v2"
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Port (if needed)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "3gpp-guidance": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js", "--port", "3001"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/3gpp-mcp-server/3gpp-mcp-server-v2"
    }
  }
}
```

### Logging (for debugging)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "3gpp-guidance": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js", "--verbose"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/3gpp-mcp-server/3gpp-mcp-server-v2"
    }
  }
}
```
