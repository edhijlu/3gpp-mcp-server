## Example 1: Understanding 5G Converged Charging 💰

### Query: "How does 5G converged charging work and what do I need to implement CHF?"

---

### ❌ Regular LLM Response

> 5G converged charging typically combines online and offline charging into a single system. The CHF (Charging Function) is a network function that handles both real-time charging for prepaid services and post-processing charging for postpaid billing.
>
> The charging process includes:
> - Charging data collection from network functions
> - Rating and tariff application
> - Balance management for online charging
> - CDR generation for offline charging
>
> The CHF uses HTTP/2-based interfaces instead of traditional Diameter protocols. You would need to implement the Nchf interface and follow service-based architecture patterns.
>
> For implementation, you would need to understand the charging architecture and follow the relevant 3GPP specifications.

**Problems**:
- ❌ Vague and generic
- ❌ No specific guidance on where to start
- ❌ No actionable next steps
- ❌ Missing implementation details
- ❌ No learning structure
