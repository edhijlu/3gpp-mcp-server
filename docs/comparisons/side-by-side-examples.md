## Example 1: Understanding 5G Authentication 🔐

### Query: "How does 5G authentication work and what do I need to implement it?"

---

### ❌ Regular LLM Response

> 5G authentication typically uses 5G-AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) as the primary method. The process involves mutual authentication between the user equipment (UE) and the network.
>
> The authentication process includes:
> - Initial authentication request
> - Challenge-response mechanism
> - Key derivation and distribution
> - Security context establishment
>
> Other methods like EAP-AKA' may also be used in certain scenarios. Authentication is crucial for ensuring security and preventing unauthorized access to the network.
>
> For implementation, you would need to understand the cryptographic algorithms involved and follow the relevant 3GPP specifications.

**Problems**:
- ❌ Vague and generic
- ❌ No specific guidance on where to start
- ❌ No actionable next steps
- ❌ Missing implementation details
- ❌ No learning structure
